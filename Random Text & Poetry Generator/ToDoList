1. create array of presets (array form or normal form, still undecided)
2. create method allowing comparison of author and machine text (guessing game!)
3. add Settings menu
4. add Save Lines method (and a place to store them...) 
5. add Hall of Fame database and button

feel free to add any ideas...
