1. create method allowing comparison of author and machine text (guessing game!)
2. finish readArray
3. create array of presets (array form or normal form, still undecided)
4. change doubles to shorts (memory conservation, need to make sure to somehow avoid rounding problems)
5. link controller to model (assign actions to buttons)

feel free to add any ideas...
